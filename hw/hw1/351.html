            <a href="https://csumb.edu/course/cst/351" target="_blank">CST 351: Web Design</a> covers the principles of design when it comes to the world wide web and also layout <br>
            and structure, such as how a website and it's components such as the header and navigation, are organized. <br>
            It also goes over user-interface design and interaction as well as database interaction and web application <br>
            service design. It is important for one to understand the primary goal of user-experience design (UX) and I <br>
            believe that will be gone over in this course. A comfortable experience navigating a website is essential <br>
            when users are visiting a site you have designed. Web animation and interactivity is covered as well.
