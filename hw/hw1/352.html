            <p>
            The necessary skills needed to build functioning and dynamic webpages are taught in this course. <br>
            <strong>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)</strong>, is a webscript and <strong>MySQL (Structured Query Language)</strong> is an open <br>
            source relational database management system that runs as a server providing multi-user access to a <br>
            number of databases. 
            </p>
            <p>
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading style sheets) are also reviewed in this <br>
            course because it is encouraged to be fluent in these coding languages before attempting to learn a <br>
            webscript like PHP. With a webscript and being able to know how to work with a self-created database, <br>
            one would be able to produce websites that allow its users to insert, delete, and update anything the <br>
            programmer made possible for the database. 
            </p>
