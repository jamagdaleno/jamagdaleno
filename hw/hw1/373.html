            <p>
            Computer ethics is a reasonable and necessary course to take for the Communication Design or Computer Science <br>
            major. Not everybody in today's time shares the same types of ideas. An essential reason for having to take this course <br>
            as a requirement is because it can provide another way of looking at something, understanding, and appreciating another <br>
            viewpoint that is not your own.
            </p>
            <p>
            Throughout the life of a career and actual life, one will always be making decisions with ethical components or impacts. <br>

            plans to teach 
            students the tools needed for making such decisions.
